# Stroke Rehabilitation Through Gaming 🎮🏥

> Transforming recovery into an engaging, accessible experience using hand gesture recognition and browser-based games.

## 🌟 The Vision

Stroke recovery often involves long, repetitive rehabilitation exercises that can feel monotonous and demotivating. **What if we could turn rehabilitation into a game?**

This project combines cutting-edge hand tracking technology with simple arcade games to make stroke rehabilitation more engaging, accessible, and effective. Using just a laptop with a webcam, patients can now practice essential motor skills through interactive gameplay.

## 💡 Why This Matters

- **Accessibility**: No special equipment needed - just a browser and webcam
- **Engagement**: Gaming elements increase motivation and adherence to therapy
- **Precision**: MediaPipe technology provides accurate hand tracking for therapeutic exercises
- **Affordability**: Free, open-source solution available to anyone
- **Evidence-based**: Targets specific motor skills crucial for stroke recovery

## 🎯 Therapeutic Benefits

### Motor Skills Development
- **Hand-eye coordination** through paddle control
- **Range of motion** exercises disguised as gameplay
- **Fine motor control** improvement
- **Reaction time** enhancement
- **Sustained attention** training

### Specific Movements Trained
- **Vertical movements (Y-axis)**: Improves arm stability and endurance
- **Horizontal movements (X-axis)**: Enhances wrist rotation and lateral control
- **Position holding**: Builds muscle memory and strength

## 🕹️ Featured Games

### 1. Ping Pong
- **Target**: Vertical hand movements (Y-axis control)
- **Benefits**: Arm stability, position holding, muscle endurance
- **Mechanics**: Control paddle vertically to keep ball in play

### 2. Arcade Breakout
- **Target**: Horizontal hand movements (X-axis control)
